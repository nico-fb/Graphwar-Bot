This tool outputs the equation for a graph that will help you win in the game Graphwar. The equation
works by stringing together a lot of equations of the type **(**__)/(1+e^(-100*(x+__))) to essentially 
make a graph that can move precisely through the coordinate plane. It works by taking in mouse clicks as 
input, so try to be exact when clicking. At any time, you can press ESC to exit the screen.

Steps:
1. Line up the red rectangle with the coordinate plane in the game
2. Double-click on your player who is currently shooting
3. Now it'll essentially append a bunch of horizontal/vertical lines depending on where you click, in the order HVHVHV..., so first click where you want the first horizontal line to end and the first vertical line to start 
4. Now click where you want the first vertical line to end and the second horizontal line to start
5. Keep doing so until you've hit all desired players (keep in mind that the graph has to end on a horizontal line, so your last click should be the end of a vertical line)
6. Press ENTER on the keyboard to get the equation in the terminal

The instructions are hard to put into words, but once you play with it a bit, you'll get the hang of it.
