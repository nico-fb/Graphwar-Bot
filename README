Running this code will allow you to choose the shape of the graph you want by using
your mouse to click at the points where you want the y to change.

It works by stringing together a lot of equations of the type (__)/(1+e^(-100*(x+__)))
to essentially make a graph that can move quickly through the coordinate plane

After the mouse clicks, you can press ENTER to generate a normal graph,
1 to generate a normal graph with an added 0.1*sin(8x) wave,
2 to generate a normal graph with an added 0.2*sin(8x) wave, or
5 to generate a normal graph with an added 0.5*sin(8x) wave.
At any time you can press ESC to exit the screen.
